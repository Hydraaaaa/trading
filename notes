Timestamps differ between each timeframe, this makes the transition not seamless

Need to anchor the starting point based on timestamp in order to have the different zoom levels align perfectly

It's not just the offset that needs to be in place

The effect gets worse the further right you go

What could cause this?



Where is the mismatch between offset and total calculated number coming from?
Why isn't candle count + offset equal to the full amount of candles from the earliest time point?
